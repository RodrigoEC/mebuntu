# :computer: Mebuntu

Every year I always have to reinstall ubuntu on my machine and I always spend the whole day trying to reinstall all the things that I use on my PC, like `neovim`
and `tmux`, so I decided to create a script that reinstall all the dependencies that I need for my workflow.

## Running

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoEC/mebuntu.git
```

2. Run the `main.sh` script
```bash
bash main.sh
```

And that's it, if you eventually find some error please report it for me :heart:
